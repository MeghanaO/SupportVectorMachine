# SupportVectorMachine

Support Vector Machine classifier has been implemented on a data set.

With different values of constant C, and kernel values, different classifiers have been created for the same dataset.

The final plot indicating the support vectors have been plotted using the matplotlib package.

KFold testing has been performed using GridSearchCV.
